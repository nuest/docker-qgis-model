- `result_kmeans.shp` - shapefile with locations of objects belonging to the cluster with the highest change as determined by k-means clustering
- `result_threshold.shp` - shapefile with locations of objects detected as changed predefined threshold
- `result_unclassified.shp` - shapefile with polygons of all detected objects and their calculated parameters
